			<h3>STOP THE FLU</h3>
			<p>The flu is a serious virus and immunisation is the best way to be protected and stop its spread.</p>
			We are committed to providing high quality health care that easily assessable to the community and are providing the Trivalent Flu Vaccine free of charge and the Quadrivalent Flu Vaccine for only $9.99.</p>

			<p>Book in and see our professional team of doctors and nurses </p>

			The Flu and You <br>
			<ul><li>You could be sick for a week or more.</li>
			<li>It doesn’t matter how fit or healthy you are, you can still get the flu.</li>
			<li>You cannot get the flu from the vaccine. It does not contain any live virus.</li>
			</ul>

			<p>Flu is more serious than a common cold. Many people with flu are forced to rest in bed for a week or more, which means they can't go to work or take care of their family. Influenza and its complications can be serious and may even lead to death in some cases.</p> 

			<p>It's especially important for anyone to ask their doctor about flu vaccination if they are: </p>
			<ul><li>Aged 65 years and over</li>
			<li>Pregnant</li>
			<li>Suffering from severe asthma, diabetes, heart or kidney disease and certain chronic illnesses </li>
			<li>Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders aged 15 years and over </li>
			<li>Working or living with people in the above groups</li></ul>

			<p>Also if you work with or are in regular contact with any of the above 'at risk' people, it is important that you are vaccinated to help prevent spreading the flu to them.</p>

			<h3>FLU VACCINE 2016</h3>
			<p>This year there are 2 ‘Flu’ vaccines on the market - Quadrivalent  (4 Strain) and Trivalent (3 Strain). The Quadrivalent is a new vaccine. It carries exactly the same three strains as the Trivalent but with an added fourth ‘B’ strain. The important point is to be vaccinated against the flu. </p>
